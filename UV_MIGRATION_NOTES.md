# UV Migration Notes

This document outlines the changes made during the conversion of FastSymApi from traditional Python packaging to UV format.

## Changes Made

### 1. UV Project Structure
- Added `pyproject.toml` with project metadata and dependencies
- Created `.python-version` file specifying Python 3.12
- Generated `uv.lock` file for dependency locking
- Created `.venv/` virtual environment directory

### 2. Dependency Management Migration
- Migrated all dependencies from `requirements.txt` to `pyproject.toml`
- Updated version constraints from exact (`==`) to minimum (`>=`) for better compatibility
- Moved from pip-based dependency management to UV

### 3. purest Dependency Addition
**IMPORTANT**: As requested, the "purest" dependency has been added to the UV project file.

**Location**: `pyproject.toml` in the `[project.optional-dependencies]` section

**Status**: Currently commented out due to build issues with purest v0.0.2

**Issue**: The purest package has a broken setup.py that references a missing README.md file, causing build failures.

**Documentation**: The dependency is documented in pyproject.toml with instructions for manual installation if needed.

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with UV setup instructions
- Added both UV (recommended) and pip (legacy) setup methods
- Updated test running instructions for both package managers

### 5. Configuration Updates
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude UV-specific files (`.venv/`, `uv.lock`)
- Added build system configuration to `pyproject.toml`
- Added project metadata matching the original `setup.py`

## Project Structure After Migration

The project now supports both traditional pip-based development and modern UV-based development:

### UV Workflow (Recommended)
```bash
uv sync                                    # Install dependencies
uv run uvicorn fastsymapi:app --reload    # Run development server
uv run pytest fastsymapi_tests.py         # Run tests
```

### Legacy pip Workflow
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt           # Install dependencies  
uvicorn fastsymapi:app --reload           # Run development server
pytest fastsymapi_tests.py                # Run tests
```

## Functionality Preservation

✅ All existing functionality has been preserved
✅ Tests continue to pass
✅ FastAPI application imports and runs correctly
✅ All original dependencies are included
✅ Backward compatibility maintained with requirements.txt

## Notes on purest Integration

The purest dependency has been added to the UV project file as requested, but due to package build issues, it's currently documented as an optional dependency that can be manually installed if needed. The integration is seamless from a project structure perspective - once the purest package build issues are resolved upstream, it can be uncommented in the pyproject.toml file.
